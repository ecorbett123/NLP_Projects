# NLP Projects
This repository contains three assignments that are NLP specific. All of them I completed during my time at Columbia. 

## Project Descriptions:
Please find a brief description of each folder below. For a more indepth description, please find a README file in each respective folder.
1. **Essay Classification with a Trigram Language Model** - I built a trigram language model based on a corpus of essays to ultimately classify essays as scoring either "high" or "low", reaching over 85% accuracy.
2. **Parsing with Context Free Grammars** - I implemented the CKY (Cocke-Kasami-Younger) algorithm for parsing sentences using a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG). The parser can determine whether a sentence belongs to the language defined by a given grammar, retrieve the most probable parse tree, and evaluate its performance against a test corpus.
3. **Neural Network Dependency Parser** - I implement a feed forward neural network to predict the transitions of an arc-standard dependency parser. The network takes in a representation of the current parser state and outputs a transition (shift, left_arc, right_arc) along with a dependency relation label.
